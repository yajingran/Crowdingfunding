## Suggestions
1.Overall, the most successgul campaign are the theater campaigns, more specifically, the plays.<br/>
2.May is the best time to start a campaign, as it shows in our analysis. On the other hand, December is not a very good time to start a campaign as December has the least number of successful campaigns.<br/>
3.Generally, one of the reason campaigns fail is because the fundraising goal was set too high. However, the prime reason of a campaign failure is that the failed campaigns are less attractive to pledge people to donate.<br/>
